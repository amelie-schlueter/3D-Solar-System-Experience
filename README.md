### About the Project

---

This is a university project. The goal was to create an 3d solar experience using Three.js and SvelteKit that showcases the solar system with its planets and moons. I also added an AI chat functionality to provide even more information about specific planets.

### Features

- [x] 🖼️ AI Generated Images
- [x] 📶Streaming AI Responses using Vercel AI SDK
- [x] 🪄 CSS Animations
- [x] ↕️ Sort Functionality
- [x] ⭕ Filter Functionality
- [x] 📲 Reponsiveness

### API's used

<b>Solar and Planet Data: </b>
I used the Le Systeme Solaire API to get the data for the solar system. You can check out the API here:
[Solar API](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/rest/bodies)

To provide even more information about specific planets, I used the OpenAI API to generate text based on the data provided by the Le Systeme Solaire API. You can check out the API here:
[Open AI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)

I also used the Vercel [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) to stream the text generated by the OpenAI API.
